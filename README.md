# CafeMenuCSS
Learning CSS by building cafe menu from FreeCodeCamp

## Notes
### Elements: 
- Style
    - Change property of the element by: element{property:value} in style element. 
-div: used to group similar elements together

- Styles can also be kept in a css folder and linked to with "<link rel="stylesheet", href="styles.css">"
- For the page styling to look similar across devices, you need "<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />" 
- to select id use "#"
- to select class use "."
- to select items within class, select class then add item after. (ex. .item p{})
- comment with /* ... */
